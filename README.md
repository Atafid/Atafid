## [📕 Library Management System *(Java, 2023)*](https://github.com/Atafid/Library-Management-System) ⚠️ This project is a school project ⚠️

This Java application simulates a library management system coded from scratch, featuring user authentication, book management, and administrative functionalities. The project utilizes JavaFX and CSS for the graphical user interface, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience. The security of user credentials is implemented with hashing, using both salt and pepper techniques.

## [🖼️ Style Generative Adversarial Networks  *(Python, 2023)*](https://github.com/Atafid/StyleGan)

This project implements a StyleGAN (Generative Adversarial Networks for image synthesis) from scratch. The StyleGAN is trained to generate anime-style images of size 64x64 using a single GPU. The training dataset consists of images of anime characters, sourced from the Another Anime Face Dataset on Kaggle.

The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to easily generate anime-style images with the trained StyleGAN.

## [üìï Library Management System *(Java, 2023)*](https://github.com/Atafid/Library-Management-System) ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is a school project ‚ö†Ô∏è

This Java application simulates a library management system coded from scratch, featuring user authentication, book management, and administrative functionalities. The project utilizes JavaFX and CSS for the graphical user interface, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience. The security of user credentials is implemented with hashing, using both salt and pepper techniques.
